The 2008 version of the IEEE floating-point standard, named IEEE 754-2008, includes a 16-bit "half-precision" floating-point format. It was originally devised by computer graphics companies for storing data in which a higher dynamic range is required than can be achieved with 16-bit integers. This format has 1 sign bit, 5 exponent bits (*k* = 5), and 10 fraction bits (*n* = 10). The exponent bias is 2^{5 - 1} - 1 = 15.

Fill in the table that follows for each of the numbers given, with the following instructions for each column:

Hex: The four hexadecimal digits describing the encoded form.  
*M*: The value of the significand. This should be a number of the form *x* or *x/y*, where *x* is an integer and *y* is an integral power of 2. Examples include 0, 67/64, and 1/256.  
*E*: The integer value of the exponent.  
*V*: The numeric value represented. Use the notation *x* or *x* × 2 ^ *z*, where *x* and *z* are integers.  
*D*: The (possibly approximate) numerical value, as is printed using the `%f` formatting specification of `printf`.

As an example, to represent the 7/8, we would have *s* = 0, *M* = 7/4, and *E* = -1. Our number would therefore have an exponent field of 01110\_2 (decimal value 15 - 1 = 14) and a significand field of 1100000000\_2, giving a hex representation `3B00`. The numerical value is 0.875.

You need not fill in entries marked --.
